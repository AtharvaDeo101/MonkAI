New chat started from template MINed-Hackathon

The code returns the following error:

Failed to load "tailwindcss/base" from "blob:https://i46g5bb6emy9zyyj8.lite.vusercontent.net/8a08636f-74ce-44b6-a5c7-63f3184e570d. Modules must be served with a valid MIME type like application/javascript.", make sure it exists.
Revise the code to address the error.

The error was caused by using @import statements for Tailwind CSS, which aren't supported in the Next.js environment. I've updated the CSS file to use the standard @tailwind directives instead, which should resolve the loading issue.

using this above templete update the code to develop an application which takes text description as input and generate a music automatically, and also allow it to play that music and perfrom few more operations. Also create new seperate page which allows user to compose music my taking description as input and generate music and edit that music like trim, change pace, change frequency, upload new music, etc. Also create a new seperate page which will provide spotify

I've transformed the template into a comprehensive AI music generation application with three main sections:

Animated music-themed background

Effects panel (reverb, echo, normalize)
File upload capability
Project saving and export functionality
3. Spotify Integration Page
Spotify account connection
Playlist management
AI-generated music library
Direct integration with Spotify playlists
Music sharing and downloading
Key Components:

Using same templete I want a landing page which will contain all the info about application and its features and also provide contanct and login/signin option. Then generate a new page which will take text description fromm user and generate music. Add duration, share and save option for genberated music. And also to to play pause the music. Then generate a new page which will also take text description and generate music but it will also provide various fetures such as trim music, cut ,edit, etc to edit and make changes in music, and keep the spotify page as it is.
